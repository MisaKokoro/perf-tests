# Fixed-pool HTTP source

Publish a generated dataset as an HTTP source that a Dragonfly Seed can download.
The dataset is generated on a PVC, then served read-only by an independent nginx
FileServer. Generate it once and reuse the same source across test rounds.

This directory provides Kubernetes deployment materials. It does not introduce a
new deployment command or install Kubernetes/Dragonfly. The existing
`proxy-bench-data-prepare` command runs inside the data Job.

## What this bundle provides

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [source.env.example](source.env.example) | Shared settings for the dataset, source address, images and storage. |
| [dataset-job.tpl.yaml](dataset-job.tpl.yaml) | Generate objects and their manifest on the final PVC. |
| [file-server.tpl.yaml](file-server.tpl.yaml) | Serve the objects through an independent StatefulSet and Service. |
| [pvc.example.yaml](pvc.example.yaml) | Optional PVC for a new dataset; skip when using an existing PVC. |

The output is a reachable HTTP source and an exported `dataset-manifest.json`.
Pass that manifest to the separate plan and Seed-cache preparation commands.
This bundle does not run a benchmark or establish that a Seed is ready.

## Before starting

Provide a working cluster, a namespace, a source node and suitable storage.
The operator terminal needs kubectl, a POSIX shell, envsubst, Python 3, curl and
sha256sum. The tools themselves are Go binaries; Python is used only by the
operator-side configuration, result-handoff and HTTP checks in the walkthrough.

Provide two immutable image references that the source node can obtain:

- **TOOLS_IMAGE:** the three preparation binaries built with the
  [preparation tools Dockerfile](../../Dockerfile.tools).
- **FILE_SERVER_IMAGE:** nginx serving `/usr/share/nginx/html` on port 80, with
  HEAD and Range support. The existing
  [FileServer image](../../../../file-server/Dockerfile) provides this capability.

See [build instructions](../../README.md#build). Building a local OCI archive
does not distribute or publish it; arrange image delivery before deploying.

## Configure this dataset

From this directory, copy `source.env.example` to `source.env`, then edit it.
The [deployment walkthrough](OPERATIONS.md) gives the commands in execution order.

| Setting | What to provide |
|---|---|
| SOURCE_NAME / NAMESPACE | An independent source name and an existing namespace. |
| SOURCE_NODE | The actual source node; there is no usable default. |
| TOOLS_IMAGE / FILE_SERVER_IMAGE | Actual `repository@sha256:...` references, not mutable tags. |
| PVC_NAME | The dataset volume; check capacity, placement and write permissions. |
| BASE_URL | The final HTTP address reachable from the Seed. |
| B / N | Object bytes and count; the small example is 4194304 bytes times four. |
| PVC_STORAGE_CLASS / PVC_CAPACITY | For a new PVC only; select values for your cluster. |

When BASE_URL is empty, the configuration derives
`http://SOURCE_NAME.NAMESPACE.svc.DNS_DOMAIN`. Use this only where the Seed can
resolve and reach that Service address. An external Seed needs a provisioned
endpoint and an explicit BASE_URL; setting a URL does not create an ingress or
port forward. Choose the address before generation: it becomes part of the
immutable manifest.

The example starts with generation concurrency 1, DNS domain `cluster.local`,
UID/GID/fsGroup 1000 and small resource requests/limits. These are functional
starting values to review against your storage and cluster, not capacity-test
defaults. Existing PVC users do not apply the new-PVC example.

## Deploy once per dataset

Follow [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) in one shell session:

| Step | Action | Result to check before continuing |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Load/check source.env and render the templates. | Final BASE_URL and valid Job/server YAML. |
| 2 | Prepare storage; create a PVC only if needed. | Correct volume and an empty/absent dataset directory. |
| 3 | Run the data Job and preserve its actual result. | Successful Pod, original log and manifest reference. |
| 4 | Start nginx and export the referenced manifest. | Local manifest SHA-256 matches the generation result. |
| 5 | Check the exact manifest URLs from the Seed's network. | HEAD, full-body digest and HTTP 206 Range pass. |

The walkthrough explains the longer configuration and JSON-checking snippets,
including their inputs and outputs. Result handoff and source checks are required;
they are not repeated for every request or every unchanged test round.

## Where the data goes

The Job mounts the PVC at `/data` and generates only `dataset/`. The PVC root may
contain `lost+found` or unrelated files; the dataset directory must be empty or
absent. Storage must support sequential mounts by the Job and the server;
ReadWriteOnce does not mean only one Pod, and ReadWriteMany is not required.

| PVC path | Server mount | Use |
|---|---|---|
| dataset/objects | /usr/share/nginx/html/objects, read-only | HTTP object downloads. |
| dataset | /fixed-pool-data, read-only | Export the manifest with kubectl. |

Objects are available as `BASE_URL/objects/sha256/DIGEST`. Other files already in
the FileServer image remain available. Manifests are not published as HTTP files;
export the exact path from the successful generation result, rather than scanning
for a "latest" manifest.

## Reuse and recovery

- Repeated rounds, RATE changes and R/W changes reuse the source bytes and URL.
  R/W changes need a separate access plan, not another data Job.
- B/N changes require a new dataset. Keep the old manifest and objects immutable.
- Server, mount or network failures require service repair and HTTP rechecks.
  Restarting nginx does not regenerate data. Restore the original endpoint.
- Preserve failed generation logs and remnants before choosing a new empty
  dataset or inspecting ownership for manual cleanup. Do not adopt partial data.
- Deleting the completed Job or restarting the server does not delete the PVC.

Retain source.env, rendered resources, Job/Pod facts and imageIDs, generation
logs, the exported manifest and HTTP evidence. Once the source checks pass,
continue with [plan preparation](../../README.md#prepare-or-reuse-an-access-plan)
and [Seed preparation](../../README.md#prepare-a-target-seed-cache).
